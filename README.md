As the project manager, I would balance coaching and managing techniques to build a more cohesive and high-functioning team by adopting a collaborative approach. I would encourage open communication and actively listen to my team members' ideas and concerns. Additionally, I would provide regular feedback and constructive criticism to help them grow professionally. To motivate and appreciate my team, I would recognize their achievements publicly, offer opportunities for professional development, and create a positive work environment that fosters teamwork and camaraderie.
